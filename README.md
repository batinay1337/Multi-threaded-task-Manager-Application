# Multi-threaded Task Manager Application

In this project, I have developed an application that can manage tasks using multiple threads. The application can execute multiple tasks simultaneously and work in parallel by utilizing threads.


## Features

- Can run multiple tasks concurrently using threads.
- Can queue tasks for sequential processing.
- Can generate reports for completed tasks.
- Supports management operations such as pausing, resuming, and canceling tasks.
- Provides a simple and user-friendly command-line interface.


## Usage

1. Navigate to the application's main directory.

cd Multi-threaded-task-Manager-Application

--------------------------
 HOW TO USE?? 

c: Create a new task. In prompt you have to enter the priority, resource allocation. Time value will be calculated by your resource choice. 

d: Destroy a task. The program will prompt you to enter the task ID of the task you want to destroy.

l: Display the current task list.

r: Run task. 

f: Clean the txt file. This is important to use, so be careful :)

q: Quit the program.

NOT:: Every error or debug process will be write in output.txt file. Check some errors. 


A- To create a new task, enter C and follow the prompts. For example:

Enter priority: 1
Enter resource allocation:
Enter resource 1: 1
Enter resource 2: 1
Enter resource 3: 1
Enter resource 4: 1
Enter resource 5: 1
Enter resource 6: 1
Enter resource 7: 1
Enter resource 8: 1
Enter resource 9: 1
Enter resource 10: 1

Try it! :)
--------------------------

2. Start the application.

gcc -o main main.c


3. The application will guide you through the command line. Follow the instructions to create, start, and manage tasks.
